## Welcome to lucky roll game
Rule:
- You need KN tokens to play "X" functions (X2, X5, others are coming soon). "X" functions allow you play a small bet as 0.01 ETH and have probabilities to double up or earn back 5 times your bet values by the probabilities calculated on verified Smart Contract.
- Probabilities are always on chain. You can always audit the code by reading the contract at 0xFd3fB00FEbdFf5621160E8bE7Fc4079CA325edDd (ETH mainnet)
- The game runs on ETH Smart Contract, rewards are automatically calculated and transferred from Smart Contract.
- The randome function is created by a randon hash of the transaction timestamp, the block difficulty and the random _seed that is a hash provided by random players. You can change the algo anytime you want by sending a new seed to the random function.
